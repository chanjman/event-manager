Goal of this exercise was to learn Ruby file I/O and serialization.

#### What I've learned (and program features):

* manipulate file input and output
* read content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
* transform it into a standardized format
* utilize the data to contact a remote service
* populate a template with user data
* manipulate strings
* access Sunlightâ€™s Congressional API through the Sunlight Congress gem
* use ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating
